# LoLPatchData
League of Legends' Champion data is constantly changing due to continuous releases of new "versions" or patches of the game.
This module checks the patch version of the most recently saved dataset and compares it to the patch currently live.
If there is a new version of data, the live patch data is requested, saved, and returned.
